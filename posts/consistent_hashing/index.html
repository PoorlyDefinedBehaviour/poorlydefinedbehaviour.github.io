Several clients communicate with the same cache servers which means that if client 1 fetches the contents for the page example.com, client 2 can fetch the same contents from the cache instead of going to the oirignal server if it decides to visit example.com as well.\nWhen the first client fetches the contents for example.com a request is sent to the original server but when the second client tries to fetch the content for example.com the contents are returned from the cache server\nRunning a single cache server is not feasible given the amount of data it would need to store could be huge and if the cache stopped for working for any reason, the clients would go directly to the original servers that have content the clients wish to download and the servers could get overloaded.\nClient can't connect to the cache so it goes directly to the server\nThe single point of failure can be removed by running many cache servers instead of just one but that creates other problems with one them being: how does the client know which cache should have the contents for the website it wants to visit?\nGiven a fixed number n of cache servers, identified by a number from 0 to n - 1, the client can mod the hash of the url by n to find out which cache server a request should be sent to. Since the same input will always hash to the same value, different clients trying to fetch the contents for the same url would always go for the same cache.\nClients hash the url to find out which cache server to contact\nIn reality there would be a large number of cache servers instead of just a few which means some cache servers would stop working and that new cache servers would be added all the time. Using the hash of the url mod the number of cache servers invalidates most of the cached data as soon as the number of cache servers changes since the hash mod the number of servers may yield a different number when the number of servers changes. It would be nice to be able to change the number of cache servers while keeping the as much as possible of the cached contents.\nSince a new server was added, the result of mod operation changes which causes clients to contact a cache server that does not have the contents they are looking for. The contents are in cache 1.\nConsistent hashing allows the number of cache servers to be changed while invalidating only a small part of the cached data. The clients are still going the hash the url to find out which server a request should be sent to but instead of using the hash mod the number of servers to find the server, servers are going to be in a ring.\nA ring containing 3 cache servers. The position of each cache server in the ring is found by hashing something that identifies each server such as the server address\nGiven a ring, the server identifiers are hashed and the hash value is used to decide where each server is located in the ring. A client that needs to decide which cache server should handle a request hashes the url and uses the value of the hash to determine where the url is located in the ring, after locating the url in the ring, the request is sent to the next server in the clockwise direction starting from the url location.\nThe hash value of example.com is located after Cache 1 and before Cache 2 in the ring which means Cache 2 is the cache server responsible for handling the request because is it is the next server in the clockwise direction\nIn constrat to the previous hash based solution, adding or removing a server invalidates only a small part of the cached data. Before adding the cache server Cache 3, a client looking for the contents of mysite.com would hash the url, the hash value would land after Cache 0 and before Cache 1 in the ring. The client would walk the ring in the clockwise direction, find Cache 1 and sent the request to it. If a client wanted to fetch the contents for example.com, it would execute the same steps and sent the request to Cache 2.\nAfter adding the cache server Cache 3, a client looking for the contents of mysite.com would execute the same steps as before but this time while walking the ring in the clockwise direction, Cache 3 would be the first server to be found which means the client would send the request to it. If a client wanted to fetch the contents for example.com again, the request would still go to Cache 2, same as before.\nCache 3 was added and the only partition of the cached data that a client won't find in the next request before it is cached in another cache server is the cached contents for mysite.com\nAt this time, the contents for each url are stored only in a single server, if higher fault-tolerance is needed, the contents could be stored in more than one of the servers. The data could be replicated to the next n servers instead of the first server in the clockwise direction or more than one hash function could be used to find which servers should have the data.\nThe contents of example.com are stored in Cache Cache 1, Cache 0 and Cache 3 at the same time\nSince hash functions are being used to place servers in the ring, it is possible that some serves end up responsible for larger sections of the ring. It is possible to decrease the change of a single server being responsible for a large section of the ring by using virtual servers, meaning that each server will appear in several locations of the ring. The use of virtual servers also allows cache servers that have more resources to store more data and handle more requests, a server that has more resources can appear more times than other servers for example. A way to decide where to place the same server is to use more than once hash function to find the server location in the ring.\nCache 1 appears more than once in the ring because it has enough resources to handle 3 times more the number of requests other servers can handle\nAmazon Dynamo, Amazon’s highly available key-value store used consistent hashing with virtual nodes to partition the load across storage servers3.\nScyllaDB, a distributed NoSQL wide-column database uses consistent hashing to assign rows to partitions4.\nCassandra, a distributed NoSQL wide-column database uses consistent hashing to assign data to nodes5.\nChord, a distributed lookup protocol that maps keys onto nodes uses a variant of consistent hashing6.\nRiak, a distributed NoSQL key-value database uses consistent hashing to decide which virtual node in the cluster stores each object7.\nhttps://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2950-u/f10/papers/chash99www.pdf ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing) ↩︎\nhttps://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf ↩︎\nhttps://opensource.docs.scylladb.com/stable/architecture/ringarchitecture/ ↩︎\nhttps://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archDataDistributeHashing.html ↩︎\nhttps://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf ↩︎\nhttps://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/latest/learn/glossary/index.html#consistent-hashing ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1242","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2023-10-06T20:00:00-03:00","dateModified":"2023-10-06T20:00:00-03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"poorlydefinedbehaviour"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/posts/consistent_hashing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Consistent hashing</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-10-06 20:00:00 -0300 -0300'>October 6, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;poorlydefinedbehaviour&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/PoorlyDefinedBehaviour/poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/consistent_hashing/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>As the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web>World Wide Web</a> became more popular all of sudden a server could receive way more traffic than it could handle causing the server to service requests slowly or to not be able to serve them at all<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.
