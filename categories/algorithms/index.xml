      <description>Intro Token bucket is an algorithm that can be used to rate limit requests made or received by a service.
How it works The algorithm is called token bucket because of the way it works: imagine we have a bucket with x tokens where each accepted request consumes one token from the bucket and a token is added back to the bucket at an interval.
A bucket with 1 token that is refilled each second means the service accepts one request per second.</description>

      <description>Replicated And Fault Tolerant Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.
The authors claim Raft to be more understandable than Paxos because Raft separates the key elements of consensus
 Leader election Log replication Safety  and enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.
Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing cluster membership.
What is a consensus algorithm Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.</description>
