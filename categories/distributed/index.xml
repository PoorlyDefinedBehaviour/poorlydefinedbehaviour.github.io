      <description>What is a log A log is just a immutable sequence of records that can be used to provide durability, replication and to model consensus. It is usually a 0 indexed file that new entries are appended to because expensive disk seeks can usually be avoided when appending to a file1.
 Not to be confused with the type of logs most people are used to: application logs that are meant to be read by humans.</description>

      <description>Replicated And Fault Tolerant Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.
The authors claim Raft to be more understandable than Paxos because Raft separates the key elements of consensus
 Leader election Log replication Safety  and enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.
Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing cluster membership.
What is a consensus algorithm Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.</description>
