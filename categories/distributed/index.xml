      <description>Intro I have just joined a company that uses Consul among several other tools. Consul is usually used for service discovery and while reading its documentation, i found out it uses SWIM &amp;ndash; a gossip protocol &amp;ndash; to manage cluster membership.
References SWIM: Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol

      <description>Replicated And Fault Tolerant Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.
The authors claim Raft to be more understandable than Paxos because Raft separates the key elements of consensus
 Leader election Log replication Safety  and enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.
Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing cluster membership.
What is a consensus algorithm Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.</description>
