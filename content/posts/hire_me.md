## EXPERIENCE
**Software Engineer** | Jan 2023 - Present
**Grafana Labs**, Remote  
- Grafana Labs is the company behind [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki), [Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir), and [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo), the leading open-
source software for visualizing operational data.
- Implemented a feature that allows Grafana engineers to deploy changes from their pull
requests to the hosted Grafana cloud environment in under **10 minutes instead of hours**.
- Worked on Grafana [private data source connect](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/connect-externally-hosted/private-data-source-connect/) which is a way for Grafana cloud customers
to establish a **secure connection from their infrastructure to Grafana Cloud**. Being able to
create a secure connection without accepting incoming connections is a key requirement for
several enterprise customers.
- Made major contributions to a thin routing layer responsible for routing every Grafana cloud
request between several cloud providers
- Member of the Grafana as a Service vertical, responsible for handling the Grafana cloud
offering which enables observability without the overhead of building, installing, maintaining,
and scaling your observability stack.
- Utilizing **Kubernetes**, **Go**, and **MySQL** to develop and enhance the Grafana cloud platform,
providing users with a scalable, reliable, and performant managed observability solution.
- Utilizing **Terraform** to provision and deploy resources on multiple cloud providers, including
**Amazon Web Services**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure**, as Grafana Cloud is a **multi-cloud** solution.  

**Software Engineer** | April 2022 – Jan 2023
**iFood**, São Paulo  
- iFood is a Brazilian online food ordering and food delivery platform, operating in Brazil and
Colombia. The company holds over **80% market share** of the food delivery sector in Brazil.
- Joined a newly formed team at iFood with the objective of building the necessary
**microservices** to enable the company's transition from a food delivery service to a platform
capable of delivering goods as well.
- Designed and developed both synchronous and asynchronous microservices, leveraging the
strengths of Rust to ensure **high performance**, **reliability**, and **maintainability**.
- Developed microservices that processed **millions of messages from Kafka**, providing real-
time event-driven processing and enabling efficient data flow within the platform.
- Implemented **fault-tolerant** mechanisms such as timeouts, circuit breakers, and fallbacks,
ensuring the resilience and robustness of the microservices in the face of potential failures and
high message loads.
- Actively contributed to the team's continuous improvement efforts, **sharing knowledge**, best
practices, and lessons learned regarding **Rust** and building scalable microservices.
- Utilized Terraform to provision and manage resources on Amazon Web Services, enabling
infrastructure automation and consistent infrastructure-as-code practices.
- Leveraged **Kubernetes** for application deployment and orchestration, facilitating scalable and
efficient management of microservices in a containerized environment.  

**Software Engineer** | May 2021 – April 2022 **Red Ventures**, São Paulo
- Contributed to a high-impact team at Red Ventures, involved in developing a solution for one
of the **largest banks in Brazil**, which generated a significant portion of the company's revenue.
- Utilized **Go**, along with asynchronous messaging patterns and **AWS SNS/SQS**, to enable
event-driven architectures, allowing for scalable and loosely coupled systems.
- Actively participated in code reviews, ensuring adherence to coding best practices,
maintaining code quality, and **promoting collaboration** among team members.  

**Software Engineer** | Feb 2020 - Apr 2021

**MongoDB**, ensuring efficient data organization and retrieval.
- **Architected and implemented critical backend features**, such as Node.js REST APIs and
asynchronous workflows using queues, significantly enhancing functionality and user
experiences.
- **Played a key role in introducing new engineers to the projec**t, providing mentorship, and
facilitating their seamless integration into the team.
- Established monitoring infrastructure using Sentry, enabling proactive error detection and
rapid issue resolution.
- Implemented robust continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines using CircleCI
and GitHub Actions, enabling streamlined and reliable feature deployment, reducing time to
market.
