I'm back in university after taking a semester off and I can't help but notice the difference in mindset of the people I usually hang around with and most people I see at university. Most people in my classes have never worked as engineers and I suspect that many of them never write code if there isn't some course work forcing them to do so. I know for a fact that some of my university friends never did write code in their free time because they told me so. Unsurprisingly they weren't able to find jobs and ended up dropping out or switching degrees.

I'm sure there are some people that are really good at what they do and I just don't know them but it seems like the majority of people are worried about how many words an essay should have or how they should behave to get a referral from their professor to get a job at an unknown local company that offers low compensation and unchallenging work that will not help them become better engineers.

The lack of ambition or short sightedness seems to be a common theme in university and some internet circles and I would even go as far as saying that some people cultivate a cult of mediocrity where the defining mindset is "never do anything to improve your skills" and trying to do anything else is met with discouragement and cheeky jokes. I wonder if someone "trying to be different" is the problem.

I took a distributed systems course around two semesters ago, distributed systems have been my main interest for some time now, having watched [MIT 6.824: Distributed systems], saying my expectations for the course were high does not make it justice. I was expecting we would read papers such as [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System], [The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems], [Paxos made simple], [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm], [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data], [Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store] , talk about them and implement at least basic versions of some of them.

We ended up just reading a few chapters from a [book](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds4/) about distributed systems and playing with some basic AWS services. I complained about such things many times in random conversations, telling people that courses should require more, they usually reply with "most people would not pass the course if we did that".

Unfortunately, credentialism is strong to a point where some people are so disconnected from reality that they may think obviously false statements such as "having a degree makes someone a senior engineer" could make sense. Seems like people are under the impression that passing a course is enough or worse, they may think that passing a course is the point.

Compensation comes up often in conversations with my friends and I tend to encourage them to put the effort necessary and seek compensation at the higher end of the scale. It is not uncommon to hear replies that resemble something along the lines of "not everyone is able to get into that company", "most people can only do basic stuff".

Seems like engineers could be divided in two groups: the group where people are past some kind of barrier and are able to aim for more interesting projects and higher compensation and the group of people that are unable to improve their skills, in many cases because of obstacles created by themselves.
